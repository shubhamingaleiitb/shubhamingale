                            <p>Today, I want to address a topic that holds great significance: fear. Each and every one of us experiences fear in our lives. We fear failure, falling behind, and feelings of incompetence. Our fears may differ, but when fear strikes, it can be paralyzing. I can personally attest to this, as I have felt and still occasionally feel the weight of fear. Tears well up in our eyes, and at times, it seems like the only option is to succumb. It is important to acknowledge that there is nothing wrong with shedding tears; I, too, have shed them. However, what nobody tells us is that conquering fear is not an overnight endeavor. It is a daily battle.<br><br>
                                When you awaken, fear greets you the moment the alarm clock rings, and throughout the day, it may haunt you repeatedly. But remember this, and never forget it: you are not perfect, and neither is anyone else. It is okay not to meet society's standards of perfection on paper. It is okay to stumble and fail. It is okay to shed tears. The true mark of a fighter lies in the ability to persevere, not necessarily to emerge victorious. Yes, we all make mistakes. I make them, you make them, our parents, teachers, and friends make them—everyone does. Fight against your fears, and refuse to surrender. What other choice do we have?<br><br>
                                
                                We are fighters, not necessarily winners. Fight, fight, fight. Be honest, be humble. You never know what others are going through, and your words hold immense power when someone is facing challenges. Choose to uplift and motivate those in need. Spread hope throughout the world, for I know firsthand the value of hope and the transformative effect that even a few kind words can have. Let us make a commitment here and now. I make it alongside you. I will fight and never give up, regardless of the circumstances, place, or time. I am a fighter, and I refuse to surrender. I may not be perfect or the best, but I will fight with unparalleled determination. Winners do not necessarily radiate hope, but fighters do. Hope—that is what fuels our world.

                            <p>Am I ahead or behind?<br>
                                Is there a point defined?<br>
                                Should I wait and celebrate or target ahead?<br>
                                Some say we choose between the two, all other choices fade.<br> 
                                But is this the reality?<br>
                                Or just an ubiquitous fallacy?<br>
                                We however have a choice untouched,<br>
                                It's not just celebrating or getting rushed,<br>
                                It's the middle way, we can do both,<br>
                                Not too much oriented and not too much sloth.<br>
                                We often get hurtled by others' success,<br>
                                Isn't that relative, some happy while some filled with sadness.<br>
                                We don't have to run this race like others do,<br>
                                Some may think that in this state we are left with no clue.<br>
                                We can run, not to reach a point,<br>
                                Not just to make someone happy or disappoint,<br>
                                We run, to enjoy the beauty that lays ahead,<br>
                                Because everything is temporary but beauty never fades.<br>
                                We can enjoy the run and not think of it as a chore,<br>
                                Life is very small my friend, to live life that sore.<br><br>

                                In some room falling for a maiden,<br>
                                While in some we are cherishing moments in a scenic garden.<br><br>

                                We don't have to lock any rooms and be shameful,<br>
                                Because they are what make other rooms graceful.<br><br>
                                
                                One day this castle will collapse and we can't hide,<br>
                                At the end, will we be full of regrets or satisfied?<br>
                                Will we be worried or let it fall with a smile?<br>
                                It's a beautiful life, enjoy it every while!<br><br>
